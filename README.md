## 🗂️ Project Features

- **User Registration** (Admin / Applicant)
- **License Application** and multiple license types
- **Vehicle Information Management**
- **Test Scheduling & Results**
- **License Issuance & Renewal**
- **Payment Management**

## 🧱 Database Design

- **ER Diagram** (not included in repo, but designed in project)
- **9 Tables** designed with proper normalization up to 3NF:
  - `Applicant`
  - `LicenseType`
  - `Vehicle`
  - `License`
  - `Test`
  - `TestSchedule`
  - `User`
  - `Payment`
  - `Renewal`

Each table includes **primary keys**, **foreign keys**, **constraints**, and **referential integrity rules**.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `DDL.pdf`: Initial table creation statements  
- `Normalized DDL Statements.pdf`: Final normalized version of DDL  
- `TABLES.pdf`: Sample data (INSERT statements) for all tables  
- ER diagram and functional dependencies (available offline)

---

## 💡 Technologies Used

- **MySQL**
- ER Modeling Tools (e.g., Draw.io)
- SQL (DDL, DML)
- Normalization & Schema Design Principles

---

## 🔧 How to Run

1. Import the DDL statements from `Normalized DDL Statements.pdf` in your SQL environment.
2. Insert data using queries from `TABLES.pdf`.
3. You can run `SELECT`, `JOIN`, `UPDATE`, and other queries to test various workflows (like test result updates, renewal date changes, etc.)
